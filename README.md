# Human_Activity_Recognition_Using_Smartphones

Designed a Neural Net to classify activity done by an individual into 12 Categories using Smartphone sensor data.
Since, most of the smartphones are equipped with tri-axial sensors which keeps track of orientation of the smartphone in space.

In this project the data from the orientation data (x/y/z - axis) from smartphone is logged as a dataframe and fed to a neural net to classify the activites 
the smartphone owner is doing.

12- Activity Categories:

1 WALKING

2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS

3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

4 SITTING

5 STANDING

6 LAYING

7 STAND_TO_SIT

8 SIT_TO_STAND
